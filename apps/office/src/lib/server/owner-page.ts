// Which requests the office answers. It runs on the owner's computer, where
// any web page the owner opens can send it requests, so `guardOffice` (the
// server's `handle` in hooks.server.ts) checks every request before a route
// sees it:
//
// - In the desktop app, first of all, the request must carry the app's key
//   (app-key.ts): the window's cookie, or the shell's header where the shell
//   calls. A sign-in callback, a run's gateway call, the shell's proof
//   request and a link the shell made for the owner's browser pass without it. No other program on the
//   computer has the key, so none can read the office or act in its name.
//   An office run from source has no key and skips this rule.
// - The request must come from this computer (`fromThisComputer`, in
//   this-computer.ts, which Vite's dev server asks first too). Through
//   Caddy, which on a Mac and Linux listens on every address, the connection
//   is always from 127.0.0.1, so the office reads the address Caddy forwards
//   for (X-Forwarded-For), which Caddy writes itself. A program on this
//   computer can write that header too; this check keeps out other machines,
//   not other programs. Every entry counts, since a Caddy that trusts the
//   client appends to what it sent, and an entry that is not a plain address
//   (a port, brackets, a name, empty) counts as another computer.
// - The Host must be one of the office's own names. A page that points a
//   name of its own at 127.0.0.1 (DNS rebinding) counts as same-origin to the
//   browser, so only the name it asked for gives it away.
// - Anything that is not a read (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) must come from the
//   owner's own page (`fromOwnerPage`), in every mode. SvelteKit's own check
//   covers form posts only, so the office checks every action itself.
//   The other clients are the app's shell, which reports updates to
//   /api/update and asks for browser links at /api/browser-link with the key
//   (`fromShell`), and an Odd's run, which reaches its outside tools through
//   /api/gateway with the token the office gave that run (`fromRun`).
//
// A plain comparison of Origin with the office's own address would refuse the
// owner's page through Caddy, which reaches the office over http while the
// page is https, so `fromOwnerPage` compares what the browser itself says.
