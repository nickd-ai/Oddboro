// Running a staffer: each chat message or job run is Claude Code, or Grok, Codex
// or Gemini for an Odd the owner moved to one (cli.ts), run headless, with the staffer's job
// description from Postgres added to the system prompt. Server only.
//
// A Claude Code run gets the office's file tools where `FILES_VIA_OFFICE` says,
// else its own five (Read, Glob, Grep, Write, Edit), and with the owner's switches as its tool takes them (`OwnTools`), Bash in
// Claude Code's sandbox and WebSearch and WebFetch. It may read only its own
// folder, the owner's data folder, on a thread the thread's folder, and the
// folders the owner gave it (see `readable`), may write only inside the
// staffer's own folder, its own part of that thread's and the folders the
// owner gave it to change, except its tools' own instructions (`INSTRUCTIONS`
// in files.ts), git's usual places in a folder the owner gave it (hooks, the
// config file, submodules' copies: `REPO_RUNS`, which says what they do not
// stop) and, reading the owner's edit, that file (`deniedEdits`),
// loads no project settings, skills or plugins, and is denied anything not
// pre-approved. It always gets the office server (asks,
// tasks, the ledger), plus whatever access the owner granted: servers at read
// level (the tools the server marks as only reading, `readsOnly`) or at write
// level (every tool), each through the office's gateway (gateway.ts), which
// keeps the keys and sign-ins. Hosted servers get a fresh OAuth token per run.
