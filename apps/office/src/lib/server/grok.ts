// How a staffer's run starts on Grok instead of Claude Code: the arguments and
// the environment, which run() in staff.ts spawns the grok `grokCommand`
// finds with. Server only.
//
// Grok keeps its sign-in, sessions and sandbox profiles in the office's own
// Grok home (GROK_HOME), never the owner's ~/.grok. The office never edits that
// home's config.toml, which belongs to the sign-in: it switches Grok's reading
// of other tools' setups (Claude's, Cursor's) off through the environment,
// which beats config.toml. The office carries a Grok Odd's files on every
// system (`FILES_VIA_OFFICE`): Grok's own file tools are never given, and the
// office's file tools (files-server.ts in the ledger) are its only way to
// files, so a change to Grok's own tools cannot widen what an Odd reads. Under
// them, on a Mac and on Linux, a sandbox profile the kernel enforces holds the
// whole run as a second wall, built on `strict`: it reads the Odd's folder (the run's cwd),
// node and the tool server's code, Grok's home and the system folders Grok
// needs to start. It writes the Odd's folder, Grok's own temp folder and
// Grok's sessions folder, which holds every Grok Odd's sessions. It adds the
// folders the run reads besides its own (the owner's data folder, its
// thread's or a lead's goals', and the folders the owner gave the Odd) to
// read, and the given folders it may change, and on a thread the Odd's part
// of it, to write.
// Deny rules hold the rest: no Odd reads anything of the kernel's allowance
// but its own folders (`UNREADABLE`), and none writes in Grok's home. A custom
// profile that cannot apply stops Grok from starting, so a run is never left
// unconfined. The profile holds the whole grok process, its own sign-in
// renewal included, so the office renews the sign-in before a run that could
// outlast it (`grokSignedOut`). Where the Mac's Docker socket is a link, the
// run gets a home of its own so Grok's sandbox can start (`runHome`).
// Windows has no Grok sandbox, so there the office's tools are the wall.
