// Once, when the office server starts: the certificates this computer trusts
// (`trustSystemCertificates`), the office home closed to other accounts
// (`makeHomePrivate`), the office's own database if .env names
// no other (copied aside first on a new version's first start), the tables
// brought up to date, the update row reset, then the job clock, the follow-up
// watcher, one read of the New Altitude personas, and the office's address in
// the owner's Caddy if it uses theirs (never in the app, which has no address).
// Each step's time goes to the log and to /api/health (`#lib/server/health.ts`).
// In the app (ODDBORO_APP) it also quits when the app does: on SIGTERM, once
// the HTTP server has closed, and when the app's stdin pipe closes, which
// happens however the app ends, Force Quit included. The first line on that
// pipe is the app's key, which every request in the app must carry
// (`#lib/server/app-key.ts`); the office waits for it before anything else.
// On a Mac it keeps its secrets through the app's shell, over those same
// pipes (`useShellSecrets`).
// Every route and API request passes `guardOffice` first: in the app only
// with the key, only from this computer, at the office's own names, and
// actions only from the owner's page (`#lib/server/owner-page.ts`).
// Files built into the page (scripts, styles, images) are served before it.
// Then Sentry's handle, which traces the request when the owner said yes to diagnostics.
