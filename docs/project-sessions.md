# Work in a native project session

Project sessions need **Advanced mode**, which is off until you turn it on. While it is off, the office shows no Projects button and no **Project sessions** menu item, gives no Odd the project tools, and refuses every project request.

## Turn on Advanced mode

1. Click **Setup** under the office's name.
2. Under **Advanced**, click **Turn on**.
3. Read the warning: work sent to Claude Code or Codex runs with your permissions on this computer, outside Oddboro's limits, and can change files, run commands or reach the internet as your coding tool allows.
4. Click **Turn on advanced mode**. **Projects** appears in the top bar.

The ledger keeps your yes, with the date and the warning's words. Turning it off is a ledger line too. It takes every Odd off every session and stops project work still waiting. Open terminal views close. Work already running in Claude Code or Codex keeps running there, and the conversations stay in the native tool.

## Open Projects

Open **Projects** in the office's top bar, or **Project sessions** from the plus menu beside an Odd's chat box. Projects opens as a tab in the side panel, which widens to the Odd's chat, or to the Odds while no chat is open. Drag its edge to make it narrower; the office remembers that width for Projects alone. Hovering the Odds narrows it so you can pick one. The music player stays where it is. The tab's ✕ closes Projects; sessions keep running.

- Every session is listed down the start side: the tool's mark, the project folder's name, the conversation title under it, and a dot for its state (sea for working, ember for waiting for you, moss for done, grey for idle). A portrait shows the Odd allowed to send work there, ringed in ember when it may send without asking. Up and Down move between sessions; Enter opens one.
- The selected session fills the rest: a slim header (folder, tool, the conversation ID to copy, **Take control of terminal**, **Details**, **Disconnect**) and the native terminal under it, which fills the space and refits as the panel changes size.
- **Details** folds out over the terminal: the instruction or correction box, Codex's questions, the Odd allowed to send work, **Let <Odd> send work without asking**, and every request with its state. A count on **Details** says how many wait for you.

The office opens the Codex or Claude Code installed on this computer. The native client reads its usual account, project instructions, skills, hooks and tool settings. A worktree is a separate project. The session identifies the project by its full path and the conversation by its native ID.

## Start or connect

1. Click **+ New session** at the top of the list. Choose the project folder and coding tool. Select **Start new** to open a fresh conversation.
2. To continue earlier work, choose **Find existing** and select the conversation by title, activity time and ID.
3. For Codex work still running on a separate App Server, enter its private Unix socket under **Connect to a running Codex server** before searching. Use the socket the original client connected to. The socket's parent directory must be private to your account. For example, a server launched with `codex app-server --listen unix:///path/to/private/codex.sock` and a terminal launched with `codex --remote unix:///path/to/private/codex.sock` share that server. The office can join a turn in progress there. On a client that keeps its server private, finish or interrupt the turn and **close the original client**. Select **Hand over this conversation** in Projects. The office resumes its saved ID.
4. For a running Claude Code terminal, enter `/bg` in the original session. Choose **Find existing** again, then select its running entry. The office attaches to the background job. To give this existing session office assignments, follow the plugin commands under **Details**. A fresh session or saved conversation launched by the office loads the plugin for that launch.
5. Choose **Open terminal** to use native commands, respond to the provider's prompts and work with files. For an office instruction, open **Details** and enter a project-relative filename under **Project file**. Codex receives supported images as native image inputs. Claude reads the file in the selected project. Keep your usual project permissions. A first visit to a folder can present the provider's normal trust question.

One office terminal view accepts typing at a time. **Take control of terminal** transfers input to another view. Closing Projects detaches the view. **Disconnect** releases the office connection after current work finishes. To pick the work up outside the office, resume the displayed conversation ID from its project folder, or attach to its existing Claude background job. Close the prior writer before a saved-session handover. The office never asks the provider to fork to resolve contention.

## Give an Odd work

1. Open the intended session, then **Details**. Under **Odd allowed to send work**, choose the Odd. This gives that Odd access to a native session with your project's tools and settings. Choose **Only me** to revoke the grant.
2. In the Odd's chat, describe the project work you want. The Odd sees the sessions shared with it. It can read its request status and send an assignment. It cannot type in the terminal, approve a command or grant itself access.
3. At Read, the Odd can look up its assignments. At Draft or Act, the proposed instruction appears on the Desk and opens the exact session. **Take over and send** runs the displayed instruction as you, with the permissions already configured in your native session. The office checks the Odd's current access again before sending.
4. To let that Odd send without asking, tick **Let <Odd> send work without asking** and confirm the second warning. Only the Odd the session is shared with can have it, and only while it is at Act. Choosing another Odd, or **Only me**, clears it.
5. Open Projects to see the answer. Results include any file references returned by the native tool. An Odd's result also reaches its Desk report. Work assigned from an office thread queues a pickup on that same thread. Revocation cancels waiting work. Inspect an assignment that already reached the provider before stopping it.

During a Codex turn, **Send correction** steers that turn. **Stop** targets the turn shown when you clicked. A resolved permission request cannot authorize a later one. With Claude, a correction waits for the paired plugin to read it. The office distinguishes a pending correction from one Claude received. For a Claude interrupt, check the terminal before clearing the request. The owner can also speak directly in either terminal.

## If delivery is unclear

The office saves the instruction before submitting it. A connection failure after submission can leave a tool action complete even though the office missed its reply. Reconnect, inspect the native history and project files, then clear the uncertain request. Sending a new instruction is a separate action. If Claude is waiting to take an assignment, open its terminal to see trust, sign-in, permission or plugin messages. Managed installations must permit the plugin and its monitor. An attached background job belongs to Claude and can outlive the office.

| Which Odd may send this request, and what survives a crash? | `packages/ledger/src/project-sessions.ts` locks the session row when granting access or claiming the next request. Both refuse while Advanced mode is off, and an Odd's request waits for the owner unless the session's `sends_unasked` names that Odd at Act. One transaction completes the request and creates the Odd's delivery. |
| Which client owns this conversation?                        | `apps/office/src/lib/server/project-sessions/controller.ts` holds one runtime per office connection. The Codex adapter shares the office's authenticated loopback server with its terminal, or joins the socket chosen by the owner. Matching includes the server and native thread ID.                                               |
| How does work reach interactive Claude?                     | `claude-project.ts` creates a local plugin for one pairing. Its monitor announces a request ID. `packages/ledger/src/project-session-tools.ts` checks the native session ID and real project path before reading the assignment or posting a reply. It gets no database credentials.                                                  |
| Who can control the terminal?                               | The office's existing owner-page checks guard the command route. The event stream also checks its reader. The Odd's MCP tools expose only listing and assignment. CLI arguments are passed directly to the executable.                                                                                                                |
| What does the desktop include?                              | The stage includes the local plugin, ledger helper, terminal library and native helper.

## Exercise a change

Run `npm test -w @oddboro/ledger`, `npm test -w @oddboro/office`, `npm run check-types` and `npm run lint` from the checkout using Node 24 or later. The project-session ledger tests use a disposable database. They exercise competing claims, changed grants, repeated replies and delivery to a thread.

For a native test, run a separate office on an unused office port (on Windows, an unused database port too) with a temporary office home. Use a disposable project and signed-in clients. Keep a second conversation open in the same folder. Give the first conversation a unique fact, ask an Odd to use a project-only file, correct the assignment, then inspect the reply in both the office and the original client. Compare the full native IDs. Confirm that the second conversation received nothing. Repeat with permission denial, a stopped turn, an office restart and a revoked Odd.

The desktop terminal check uses the same launcher as the office. On Windows, `packages/ledger/src/project-terminal.ts` uses the bundled console and releases the input pipe and output worker after the child exits. Keep `node-pty` pinned until the [upstream cleanup issue](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/issues/965) is fixed and the check passes without the workaround.

On a release machine, stage the desktop with the repository's smoke test. Open both terminals in the installed application, enter and resize text and exercise a native permission prompt. Windows Claude plugin monitors require Git Bash. Test a managed machine with the plugin disabled as well as a machine where it is allowed.

To run the two-provider read and resume check yourself, open the disposable office first. Pass its loopback URL and an existing disposable project folder to the script below. It creates one uniquely named fixture, asks each provider to return the value in it, verifies the original conversation IDs and removes the fixture. The native clients retain their test conversations. Open the matching Projects entry if a provider asks for permission.

```sh
node apps/office/scripts/check-live-projects.ts http://127.0.0.1:4951 /absolute/path/to/test-project
```

## Earlier native checks, November 9, 2026

On Apple silicon, the staged desktop server ran Codex CLI 0.167.0 and Claude Code 2.1.319 with their native sign-ins. Both read a fresh project file, returned its contents through the office and resumed the same native ID. A project-only skill supplied information used in each provider's answer.

- A separate Codex client started a turn on its own private socket. The office joined it and steered it. The original client saw the corrected reply. A stale Stop left the next turn alone, and its own Stop interrupted it. A real approval allowed one fixture write. A denial on a separate request left its file absent.
- A separate Claude background job already knew a test word. The office attached to that job, installed the local plugin in the test project and reloaded it in the existing conversation. An assignment came back with both the remembered word and the new instruction. In another live session Claude picked up a correction before returning a project skill's result.
- An Odd used its office MCP tools to submit work, got the file reference back and received one Desk report. Revoking the grant blocked a second instruction from the same MCP client. Two browser tabs transferred native terminal control explicitly.

The platform workflow builds and starts the staged office and checks terminal input and resizing on the Mac, Linux and Windows release architectures. It uses local fixtures. An authenticated provider run on another OS, a managed organization's plugin policy and signed installer distribution require their own release checks.

## Current queue integration

Migration 0027 adds the two tables after scheduled file exchange (0026). Migration 0028 adds `owner.advanced_at` (Advanced mode, null while off) and `project_sessions.sends_unasked` (the one Odd that may send without asking).

**Find existing** for Claude Code reads Claude Code's own session files, `projects/<project key>/<id>.jsonl` under `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `~/.claude` (`claude-sessions.ts`). It reads each file's two ends for the title, folder and last change, as the Agent SDK's `listSessions` did, without the SDK. The terminal library, `node-pty`, is an optional dependency that loads only when a terminal opens. When it is missing, `npm install` still succeeds and the terminal says it cannot open.
Session and request changes use `LIVE_TABLES`. Project
tools are declared in `OFFICE_TOOLS` and appear only for a shared conversation.
A run uses the shared `CEILING` to remain at Draft or Read. `nativeProjectEnv`
in `run-env-allow.ts` keeps native provider settings separate from office
credentials. Terminal input and output stay outside diagnostics.

Database and tool-server tests cover duplicate assignments and callbacks,
revocation, a run at Draft or Read, unchanged native IDs, and a result arriving
after its office work ended. The earlier authenticated checks above predate
this integration; the release checks still apply to the merged build.
