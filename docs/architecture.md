# The picture: where a change goes

A new kind of thing starts at its one declaration, and the type checker or a
named test then lists every other place it must reach. This page names each
declaration, the shared function for each job, and the check that fails when
a place is missed. One more of something that exists (an Odd, a room, an
office, a connector, a lesson, a goal) is a row or a JSON file and needs no
code: the office grows by adding instances, as the 2026-10-29 eight-blocks
decision in `docs/decisions/` says.

## The parts

Imports point one way. An app imports packages and a package never imports
an app; `ledger` imports `world` and `sprites`, and `world` imports `sprites`.

- `packages/ledger`. The office's records and every rule about them: the
  tables (`src/schema.ts`), what the office does with them (`src/office.ts`),
  the tool server an Odd runs with (`src/mcp.ts`), the AI tools
  (`src/agents.ts`), and what a run may reach (`src/capabilities.ts`). Server
  only, except the entries `packages/ledger/CLAUDE.md` names as the page's.
- `apps/office`. The office server and its page: the floor (`src/lib/floor/`),
  the panels (`src/lib/ui/`), the routes (`src/routes/api/`, one folder per
  thing), and running Odds (`src/lib/server/`: `staff.ts` runs one, `cli.ts`
  starts the tools other than Claude Code, `sandbox.ts` walls commands).
- `packages/world`. Rooms and offices as JSON (`rooms/`, `plans/`), an
  owner's office built from a spec (`src/generate.ts`), and `composeWorld`.
- `packages/sprites`. The art as `.px` text, the palette, the compiler.
- `apps/desktop`. The Tauri shell around the office. It imports no package;
  its contract with the server is in `apps/desktop/CLAUDE.md`.
- `apps/site`. The public site, static. It reads `sprites` and `world` only.
- `scripts`. The lint guards: plain Node, no dependencies.
- `.github/workflows`. `ci.yml` runs the checks on every pull request, on a
  Mac, Linux and Windows, unless it changes only the site or the docs;
  `site.yml` checks those; `release.yml` builds the app; `codeql.yml` scans.

## One function per job

Before writing a helper, use the one that already does the job.

| Job                                                     | Use                                                   | In                                                     |

## Adding a new kind

Each entry says where to start, then what fails when a place is missed. Where
nothing fails, it says so: name that place in the pull request.

Planned work starts where a "Later" line says, not here: the "Later" sections
of `packages/ledger/CLAUDE.md`, `apps/office/src/lib/server/CLAUDE.md`,
`apps/desktop/CLAUDE.md`, `scripts/CLAUDE.md` and `docs/CLAUDE.md` say what
comes first for a run timeline (one row per run), Stop for a run, Claude
Code's launch, a new office tool or AI tool, a release smoke test, splitting a
big file, the size guard and a long guide file. The page pass is the last line
of "Rules for this app" in `apps/office/CLAUDE.md`. Whoever does a "Later" item
deletes its line, and whoever finds this page wrong fixes it in the same
change.

- **An ask kind.** Start at `ASK_KINDS` in `packages/ledger/src/schema.ts`.
  Check-types fails at `OWNER_ANSWERS.ask` in
  `packages/ledger/src/desk-answers.ts`, which says what each answer does. A
  kind the owner answers on its own card (a reply, a filter, a folder, a call)
  gives `approve` a `by`, the line a bare yes gets, and its route approves it;
  a plain yes (a `switch`, `level` or `office_tool` ask) names its effects
  directly. Check-types then fails at `TWINS`, the repeat guard's switch in
  `raiseAsk` and `grantSetting` in `office.ts`, `carriedLinesOf` and
  `carryOutBrief` in `apps/office/src/lib/server/follow-up-brief.ts`,
  `YES_SAID` in `apps/office/src/lib/ui/yes-said.ts`, and `ASK_ROWS` in the
  office's `named-tools.test.ts`.
- **A follow-up kind.** Start at `FOLLOW_UP_KINDS` in `schema.ts`. Check-types
  fails at every `Record<FollowUpKind, ...>`, `AT_DRAFT` and
  `SERVES_NO_THREAD` in `hand-offs.ts` among them, and at the switch in
  `apps/office/src/lib/server/follow-up-brief.ts`.
- **A desk item.** Start at `DESK_ITEMS` in `desk-answers.ts`. Check-types
  fails at `OWNER_ANSWERS`, `Item` in `DeskDrawer.svelte`, `replyBrief` and
  `openDelivered`.
- **A connector kind.** Start at `CONNECTOR_KINDS` in `schema.ts`. Check-types
  fails at each switch on it, each ending in a `never` default. `builtin`
  connectors (Gmail, Google Drive) are served by the office itself (`builtin`
  in `access.ts`).
- **Something the owner can grant, or an owner control on an Odd's card.**
  Start at `OWNER_GRANTS` and `PATCH_KEY` in
  `packages/ledger/src/grantable.ts`. Check-types fails a key added to
  `STAFF_PATCH_KEYS` until `PATCH_KEY` classes it, and a new grant until
  `OWNER_GRANTS` has its row. `grantable.test.ts` holds each line an Odd
  hears about a grant it lacks. A hire's starting values are `HIRE_DEFAULTS`
  in the same file.
- **An AI tool.** Start at `AGENTS` in `packages/ledger/src/agents.ts`.
  Check-types fails at every `Record<Agent, ...>`, `AGENT_FILES` and
  `OFFICE_MODEL_VAR` among them, and at `WALLS` in
  `apps/office/src/lib/server/launch-contract.test.ts`. `agent-files.test.ts`
  fails until its instruction files and home folders are in both security
  lists.
- **An AI tool on another system.** Start at its `runs` and `commands` in
  `AGENT_PLATFORMS`. `sandbox-paths.test.ts` fails until `SANDBOX_PATHS` in
  `apps/office/src/lib/server/sandbox-paths.ts` declares that system, and
  `launch-contract.test.ts` launches the tool there. `scripts/check-platform.ts`
  fails a `process.platform` read anywhere but `currentPlatform()`.
- **A secret store.** Start at `STORE_MARKS` in `packages/ledger/src/office-folders.ts`;
  `SECRET_STORES` is its keys, so one list says what a run and a given folder
  stay out of. Each entry says how the store is found anywhere but
  the top of the home, where its name is enough.
  `own-tools.test.ts` walks every entry.
- **A variable a run needs.** Start at `RUN_ENV_ALLOW` in
  `apps/office/src/lib/server/run-env-allow.ts`, or `TOOL_SERVER_ENV` beside
  it for the tool server. `launch-contract.test.ts` fails a name that reaches
  a run unlisted. No check: a run that lacks a name it needs fails only when
  it runs.
- **An office tool.** Start at its row in `OFFICE_TOOLS` in
  `packages/ledger/src/tools.ts`, and register it in its `mcp-*.ts` file behind
  `has()`. A tool registered only alongside another, never granted alone
  (such as `my_pokes` with `poke_owner`), goes in `RIDES_WITH` instead,
  under the tool it rides with. When it is offered is a field on its row,
  never a rule in its `mcp-*.ts` file, which registers such a tool behind `offered()`:
  `withGmail` only while the Odd holds Gmail, `withWrite` only while it holds
  a service at Read and write, `inChat` only in a chat on the owner's words,
  `notToManager` never to the Office Manager.
  Whether the owner grants it is the `office_tools` row of `OWNER_GRANTS`.
  `hand-off-tool.test.ts` fails a registered tool that is neither listed nor
  rides with one, check-types fails an id `OFFICE_TOOLS` lacks in
  `STARTER_TOOLS` or `has()`. The ledger's `named-tools.test.ts` fails a
  tool's description naming an office tool the Odd does not hold, and the
  office's `named-tools.test.ts` fails the same in `house()` and every
  follow-up's brief, unless that test's `NAMES_UNHELD` declares it with the
  Linear row that owes the fix.
- **A table.** Start at its `pgTable` in `schema.ts`, then run
  `npm run db:generate`. Its row in `LIVE_TABLES` in
  `packages/ledger/src/live-tables.ts` says whether the page hears it, and its
  trigger goes in a migration by hand. CI's "Migrations match the schema"
  fails a schema change with no migration, and `live-tables.test.ts` fails a
  table with no row or a trigger its row does not say.
- **A goal status.** Start at `GOAL_STATUSES` in `schema.ts`. Check-types
  fails at every `Record<GoalStatus, ...>`, `GOAL_IS_LIVE` in `goal-words.ts`
  among them.
- **A page call or a route.** A route is a folder under
  `apps/office/src/routes/api/`, and the page reaches it through `call()`,
  `stream()` or `follow()`, which take an `ApiUrl`: check-types fails a call
  to a route that does not exist. A route the owner acts through has its row
  in `OWNER_ACTIONS` in `apps/office/src/lib/server/owner-actions.ts`;
  `owner-actions.test.ts` fails a POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE handler with
  none, a row that says it records but writes no ledger row, and a row that
  writes only sometimes (`mayRecord`, the kinds it may write and when) but
  writes a kind it does not list, or nothing in the state that writes. No check
  finds a GET or a page's `load` that changes something: give it a row by
  hand, and the test then fails if its handler goes.
- **A call out of the office.** Start at its file's entry in `OUTBOUND` in
  `scripts/outbound.ts`, with whose yes covers it (hard rule 4).
  `scripts/check-outbound.ts` fails lint when a file's calls, by the names it
  counts, differ from its entry. It counts no child process, such as an AI
  tool's run.
- **A kind of run.** Start at `UsageKind` in `schema.ts`. Check-types fails
  at `RUN_FAILURE` in `apps/office/src/lib/server/run-failures.ts`, and
  `failed-run.test.ts` holds where each failure lands. Live execution uses
  `runsGoing` in `run-registry.ts`, with a stop handle on each entry.
  `run-state.test.ts` checks admission and removal; `chat-steer.test.ts`
  checks that Stop and Send now select only the named attempt.
- **A room kind.** Start at `ROOM_KINDS` in `packages/world/src/generate.ts`.
  Check-types fails at `KIND_ABOUT` and `ROOM_ID`. No check: its furnishing
  in `recipe()`, and the rooms an Odd names in a hire proposal (`hireFields`
  in `mcp-run.ts`), which list Main Street's by hand.
- **A migration.** After a schema change, `npm run db:generate` writes it; a
  trigger, function or row goes in one by hand. `migrations.test.ts` fails a
  journal entry out of order or a file with no entry. No check runs it
  against a real office's data: do that by hand, as
  `packages/ledger/CLAUDE.md` says under "Running it".
- **A lint guard.** Start at a script in `scripts/` that fails through
  `report()`, add it to `lint:guards` in the root `package.json`, and give it
  a line in `scripts/CLAUDE.md`. No check: a guard left out of `lint:guards`
  never runs.
- **A `CLAUDE.md` or a decision.** `check-context-index.ts` fails a
  `CLAUDE.md` its nearest ancestor does not name, and `check-ledger.ts` a
  decision file out of shape (`docs/decisions/CLAUDE.md`).
