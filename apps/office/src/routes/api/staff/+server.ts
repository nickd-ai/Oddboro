// Hire a staffer, in the look drawn for them. The new row reaches the page
// through the change stream, and the staffer walks in from the lobby. Hiring
// from a proposed hire approves that ask, gives the hire its copy of the
// owner's intake, and links it to the goal it was proposed for. The first job
// comes with the hire, so the new staffer knows it when it says hello in its
// chat and gets started on its first day (`firstDay`). A hire with no job says
// hello and then runs only when it is handed work: one serving a goal gets its
// first piece from the goal's lead, whom approving the hire wakes. The tool it
// runs on, the account it signs in with there, its model and how hard it
// thinks are stored with the row, so its hello and every run after go through
// them. Left out, each is the office's.
