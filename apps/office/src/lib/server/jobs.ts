// The office clock. It keeps one timer, set for the soonest due job, poke or
// parked thread, and resets it whenever the jobs, pokes or threads table
// changes. A thread's hub parks it until a time (resume_at); the clock starts
// the hub's pick-up then. Every job run is told the scheduled time it is for
// (job-brief.ts). A job on time runs at once. One whose time passed while the
// Mac slept is settled by its kind (`dueNow` in the ledger's missed-runs.ts):
// a `latest` job catches up once if less than half a period passed since its
// newest missed time, else skips to its next time and waits on the desk's
// While you were away card; a `record` job owes a run for every missed
// period, or, past FILL_WITHOUT_ASKING of them, asks the owner first. Owed
// runs (`jobs.owed`) start one after another, never together, so waking
// after a week away is no burst. A poke that late is marked missed (see
// deliverPoke); a thread that late wakes then. While an update is about to
// install (`held()` in update.ts) it starts no scheduled job: a due one waits
// and runs once the app is back.
//
// A reader job (one whose files name an input) needs its writer's file for
// the period it runs for (`inputFor` in the ledger). While its writer still
// owes that period, the reader waits: it owes its own time instead, and gets
// in line again when the writer's run ends. When the writer skipped that
// period, the reader skips it too, and joins the While you were away card.
// While the writer's catch_up ask waits for the owner, the reader waits too;
// a no makes it skip, and the asks table's change makes it look again.
