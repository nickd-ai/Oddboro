// The gateway between an Odd's run and the outside tools it holds. A run
// never gets an outside server's address, key or sign-in: it gets one address
// per tool on the office itself (`/api/gateway/<connector>`) and a token that
// lives only as long as the run. The office holds the keys, connects to the
// real server (`upstream` in access.ts), lists only the tools the grant
// reaches, and refuses a call to any other. Read only reaches the tools that
// pass `readsOnly` now, as the server marks them on this run, and that the
// connector's stored list still names; Read and write reaches every tool. At
// Draft, Read and write still lists every tool, but a call to one that changes
// something goes on the owner's desk instead (`raiseCall`), with the Odd's
// title and reason, which each such tool asks for (`forOwner`): the office makes
// that exact call on their yes (`makeCall`), and the Odd hears the result in a
// new run. A tool the owner lets the Odd use without asking (its standing yes)
// goes straight through, and a call held after it lists it on the desk
// (`before`), so a commit shows the change it applies. At Act every call goes
// through but those to a tool the owner set to ask first, held the same way.
// Each list is the exception to its level (`waitsFor`). The tool a run goes through (Claude Code, Codex, Grok) still gets
// its own per-tool allow list too, so either one alone holds.
