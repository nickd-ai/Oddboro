 * - `carry_out`: a `carry_out` follow-up, to do what the ask or task waited on.
 * - `grant_access`: the access the ask names is granted (`grantAccess`). A tool
 *   already connected starts the work that waited on it (`carry_out`) at once;
 *   otherwise the owner gets a task to connect it, and finishing that starts it.
 * - `give_folder`: the folder the owner gave went to the Odd with the yes
 *   (`giveFolder`), and the work that waited on it starts, once for each place
 *   a result goes back to.
 * - `turn_on`: the switches the ask names turned on with the yes
 *   (`turnOnSwitches`), and the work that waited on them starts, once for each
 *   place a result goes back to.
 * - `grant_setting`: the level or office tools the ask names change with the
 *   yes, as the Settings tab changes them (`changeLevel`, `changeTools`), and
 *   the work that waited on them starts, once for each place a result goes
 *   back to.
 * - `start_held`: the hand-off the ask held starts, as the ask is claimed.
 * - `answer_window`: the usage window's answer (`answerWindow`).
 * - `answer_hand_offs`: the yes or no to more hand-offs goes to the thread's hub
 *   (`answerHandOffs`).
 * - `answer_back`: the answer itself goes to the hand-off or thread it was
 *   raised on (`answerLater`). Raised on neither, it reaches nobody.
 * - `rework`: a `rework` follow-up, with what to change.
 * - `denied_lesson`: a `denied` follow-up, when the no carries a reason.
 * - `task_done`: a `task_done` follow-up, to pick up what waited on the task.
 * - `wake_parked`: the work a lead parked on the task picks up, told how the
 *   task ended (`wakeOnTask`).
 * - `odd_leaves`: the Odd the ask names leaves the office (`removeOdd` in
 *   leaving.ts), after the answer went back, so leaving closes any run it started.
 * - `odd_returns`: the Odd the ask names comes back as it was (`bringBack`).
 * - `catch_up`: the job the ask names owes a run for its missed periods
 *   (`oweCatchUp`), which the office clock starts.
 * - `give_standing`: the tools the ask names went on the Odd's grant with the
 *   yes (`giveStanding`), so its runs use them without asking.
